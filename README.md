## Simple Poker
Simple Poker is a variant of poker that removes all decision-making from the game,
reducing it to a simple game of chance. The rules are:

- Each player is dealt 5 cards from the same deck which only they can use
- The winner is the player with the best hand according to the [standard ranking of poker hands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands#Hand-ranking_categories) (five of a kind does not apply to Simple Poker because there are no wild cards in this game)
- There is no betting, checking, folding, community cards, jokers, wild cards, or any other feature of real poker games unless it's mentioned in these rules
- Aces are always the highest value card (14) in the deck, therefore: 
  - `10, jack, queen, king, ace` **is** a straight
  - `ace, 2, 3, 4, 5` is **not** a straight

## Task
Implement the `int compareTo(PokerHand opponentHand)` method of the `PokerHand` class, such that two poker hands
can be compared. As per the contract of [Comparable.compareTo](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Comparable.html#compareTo(T)), 
this method should return:

- A positive integer if this hand is better than the opponent's hand 
- A negative integer if the opponent's hand is better than this hand
- Zero if both hands are equal (AKA a split pot) 

The `PokerHand` class has a constructor that accepts a string containing 5 cards, e.g.

```java
PokerHand hand = new PokerHand("KS 2H 5C JD TD");
```

The characteristics of this string are:

- Each card consists of two characters, where
  - The first character is the value of the card: `2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T(en), J(ack), Q(ueen), K(ing), A(ce)`
  - The second character represents the suit: `S(pades), H(earts), D(iamonds), C(lubs)`
- A space is used as a separator between cards

### Tests
The repository includes a basic suite of unit tests that should be used to verify the correctness of your solution. You are encouraged to add additional test
cases to the suite, but please don't remove or modify any of those provided. 

The tests can be run by executing `./gradlew test` on the command-line from the project's root directory.

## Guidelines
The game can be implemented using any combination of the following languages: 
- Java 
- Kotlin
- Groovy 

You are welcome to add any libraries/dependencies to the project, except for Lombok. If you use Kotlin or Groovy, you'll need to modify the 
build to support these languages.

Your solution is not limited to the files in this repository. Feel free to add your own classes, interfaces, enums, records, etc. 

The goal is to pass the test suite. If there isn't a test for a particular case, e.g. an invalid string being passed to the `PokerHand` constructor, you may ignore it.

### Java Version
By default, the project expects to build and run with JDK v21. You can use a later JDK provided you:
- Make any changes necessary to the Gradle build to support the newer JDK
- Clearly mention in your submssion which JDK version should be used

### GitHub
- Clone or download this repository, **do not fork it**
- Push your solution to a private repository in your GitHub account
- When your solution is complete, add your ClarusONE contact as a collaborator to this repository, so they can access it

## Evaluation
Ideally, we would like to receive a solution that is both

- Complete. All the test cases provided in this repository should pass. Any additional test cases you've included should
  also pass
- Implemented to a high-quality 

We're slightly more interested in the quality of the solution than completeness. A high-quality solution that 
fails a few tests will likely receive more credit than a complete, but low-quality solution.

One measure of the quality of a solution is its flexibility, e.g. if the rules were changed such that two pairs beats three-of-a-kind, how easy is it to implement this change?
